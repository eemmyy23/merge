# merge

## Task

Implement a function MERGE that receives a list of intervals and returns a list of intervals as the result. As a result, all overlapping intervals should be merged. All non-overlapping intervals are not affected.

Example:
Input: [25, 30] [2, 19] [14, 23] [4, 8] Output: [2, 23] [25, 30]
